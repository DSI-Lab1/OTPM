# OTPM
As an important sub-branch of data mining, pattern mining is nowadays applied in various fields such as healthcare, finance, traffic, and shopping basket. In order to obtain useful and concise results of interest to the user, the targeted mining method imposes a query constraint that avoids the generation of irrelevant patterns. So far, researchers have proposed many targeted mining algorithms for different mining tasks. In order to provide relevant researchers with convenient use and learning of targeted pattern mining, a project called OTPM (Open-source of Targeted Pattern Mining) deployed on GitHub is developed, which contains some targeted mining algorithms in recent years.

## Requirements
Java programming language.

## Running the program
A simple way is to run the java test file.

## Benchmarks
- Sequence data
- Transaction data
- Biological sequence

## Introduction
- **TargetUM**: The first work for mining high-utility itemsets, which is based on a TP-tree structure.
- **TaSPM**: The first work for mining sequential patterns, which is based on a C-MAP structure.
- **TaSRM**: The first work for mining sequential rules, which is based on rule expansion pruning.
- **TUSQ**: The first work for mining sequential patterns, which is based on a target chain structure.
- **TALENT**: The first work for mining non-overlapping, which is based on a Nettree structure.
- **TaRP**: The first work for mining rare high-utility patterns, which is based on a modified utility-list structure.
- **THUIM**: The improved work for mining high-utility itemsets, with the better efficiency than TargetUM.
- **TMKU**: The work for top-k mining high-utility itemsets.
